üìä Project Overview: What It Does
This project is designed to act as an AI-powered stock advisor. It likely uses financial data, machine learning models, and natural language processing to:

Analyze historical stock data
Predict future trends or prices
Provide investment advice or risk assessments
Generate human-like explanations or summaries of stock performance
It may also include a chatbot or assistant interface for user interaction.

üß† Purpose of app_com.py
This script is the main application logic for a Stock Advisor AI Consultant. It uses a local LLM (via Ollama) and LangChain to provide intelligent, conversational financial advice based on user queries.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works ‚Äì Step-by-Step
Imports & Setup

Uses langchain_community.llms.ollama to load a local LLM (e.g., llama3).
Uses langchain.agents to create a conversational agent.
Imports tools like yfinance and stocknews to fetch real-time stock data and news.
Tool Definitions

stock_price_tool: Fetches current stock prices using Yahoo Finance.
stock_news_tool: Retrieves recent news articles about a stock.
These tools are wrapped in LangChain's Tool class to be used by the agent.
Agent Initialization

A conversational agent is created using initialize_agent with:
The tools above
A local LLM (llama3)
AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION for reasoning and tool use
Memory (ConversationBufferMemory) to maintain context
User Interaction

The script enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input.
The agent processes the input, possibly using tools, and returns a response.
